The Vaalkannadi project was started as a method to set up an Ubuntu 
Local Mirror in our college (College Of Engineering,Trivandrum).
The server was running Solaris 5.10 and it was necessary to find
a solution that would be highle portable in all platforms. So we 
decided to write a mirroring script in Perl. However recently our 
project goals have been expanded.

   * Making the script completely dependent on Perl alone.

   * Writing similar scripts for other Mirrors such as rpm

   * Modularising the project

   * Providing a simple and easy to use graphical interface

   * Writing tools for Mirror Maintainers

As the project evolves and grows we hope that it creates some input 
to the open source community from which we have taken so much...
